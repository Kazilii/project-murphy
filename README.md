# project-murphy
Project Murphy is an attempt to create a reporting network on Discord between multiple servers in order to make it easier to transfer important information such as potential predators, hackers, manipulators, ect. This project can also be morphed to accommodate different needs, such as just simply communicating between the staff channels of multiple servers.
